The final representation I plan on showing you is short and sweat.\
In the previous section I showed that differentiation can be represented as multiplication.\
This takes that literally.\
This representation borrows an idea from linear algebra and matrices.\
And there are actually alot of ways you can represent differentiation using matrices.\
However, I won't be showing those because they have alot a limitations.\
But I do think it's, worthwhile, if you have the time.\
Instead, I am going to pull an idea form linear algebra that I think works very well with differentiation.

This last section is about eigen-values and eigen-functions.\
What is all this eigen stuff about?\
Well lets say, you have the differential operator D and a function f.\
If you multiply D and f. Then under the behaviors of f.\ 
D can be thought of as transforming into a constant, lambda.\
And that's it. Sweat and simply.

Why is this such a great representation?\
Well, unlike differential operators, constants are easy to manipulate.\
You can take a square root a constant, the log of a constant, even the factorial of a constant.\
And it's easy.\
And when you include integration and the constants of integration the power explodes.\
But integration isn't for this video.

As for what f actually is?\
It's also super simple.\
I's the exponential of lambda times the object that when D acts on it equals 1.\
This is because the derivative of the exponential is itself,\
and by the chain rule, it pulls lambda out.

So instead I am going leave you with an application.\
Quantum mechanics.\
So one of the core axioms of quantum mechanics is that energy is a particle waving across time.\
And momentum is a particle waving across space.\
And this is sort represented with these eigen value eigen functions.\
The eigen values being energy and momentum. And eigen function is the wave function.\
Applying the differential operator i h-bar d/dt to psi gives Energy times psi.\
Applying the differential operator -i h-bar d/dx to psi gives momentum.\
Multiplication by i plays the role of rotation though complex number space which produces sine and cosine waves. Functions closely connected to rotations.

So in any equation that you have Energy and momentum.\
You can apply this substitution. \
And you get an equation for the wave equation.\
For the classical non-relativistic energy velocity relation,\
you get the Schr√∂dinger equation.\
For the relativistic energy momentum relation\
you get the Klein-Gordon equation.

All of quantum mechanics uses this kind of mathematics.
