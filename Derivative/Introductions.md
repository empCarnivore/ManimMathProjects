Hello, everyone. \
This is a video about the derivative. 

I'll be using three different constructions.\
I will introduce\
the classical derivative,\
a lie algebra variant,\
and a linear algebra variant.

With these constructions,\
I hope to build creativity, connections, and further intuition.

I'll provide timestamps so you can skip around.\
However, I genuinely believe that everyone\
can get value from each section.\
And if you don't,\
make sure to critique me in the comments.\
Be nice though.\
This is my first video.
