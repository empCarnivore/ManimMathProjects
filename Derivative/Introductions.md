Hey, everyone. \
This is a video about the derivative by AbsMath. 

The goal of this video,\
is to introduce the derivative.\
However, I'll be using several different forms of differentiation that most have probably never encountered.

In providing these different forms of differentiation in a series,\
I hope to build connections, mathematical creativity, and further intuition.

For the general format,\
I'll have three sections.\
Each starting with foundational behaviors,\
then they will move to more complex behaviors and/ or applications.

The three sections will be an alternative to the classical derivative, a lie algebra variant, and a linear algebra variant.\
I'll provide timestamps so you can skip around.\
However, I genuinely believe that everyone can get value from each section.\
So I hope you'll find enjoyment and knowledge in each part.\
And if you don't make sure to critique me in the comments.\
Be nice though.\
This is my first video.
