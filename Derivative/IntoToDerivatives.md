To understand derivatives,\
the best place to start is with straight lines.

Here is an equation that relates an additive change in the domain, or x,\
to an additive change in the range or y.\
For the seeing impaired,\
I'll be referring to the two sides of the equation as the change in domain form,\
and the change in range form.


For those who have take an algebra class,\
you can kind of squint your eyes and get y=mx+b.\
Where green is y, blue is b, and red is x.\
Functionally, it is the same except your setting the y axis to be at the original input,\
and take the change in x, or delta x, in this case,\
to be x.

The letter m is just a constant,\
and it is equivalent to a conversion factor between delta x and delta y.\
Multiplying delta x by m turns it into delta y.\
This way when you add m times delta x to y you are equivalently adding delta y to y.,

Great. So how does this fit into derivatives.\
Well. Look at the straight line I provided.\
Can you notice anything abnormal about it?\
If you can't that's a good thing. That's what I intended. (unless your blind)\
It'll help explaining the next bit.

The special thing about this straight line is that it, in fact, is not one.\
It's a curve. I just zoomed in really close.

This goes to show that alot of curves are approximately straight when you zoom in.\
And when zoomed in,
the equation of straight lines are still use-full.\
Only now instead of m being constant. It changes at every point.

The function that describes m at each point is called the derivative.\
And it is often represented as adding the prime or apostrophe to the function its differentiating.\
