Another way to build a derivative is by using lie algebra.\
To begin to understand that,\ 
I'll have to explain the mathematics of lie algebra.

In the simplest description possible,\
Lie algebra an area of math that brings into focus the commutator.\
The commutator measures the degree in which the order you multiply two objects together matters.

The commutator of D and x is D times x minus x times D.\
Not here that although I have heavily implied that D and x are related to differentiation and the object x,\
I have yet to define them as so.\
I won't do that till later.

From the definition of commutation, there are several properties that are simply derived.\
If you swap D and x in the operation, this is equivalent to multiplying by -1.\
In a sense this sort of implies there is a kind of symmetry between the differential operator D and the object x.\
This is one of the many fascinating and use-full behaviors of differentiation, that many might not even know about.\

Another property is that it is linear. This matches closely with the already known properties of differentiation.

Another property that you can figure out with little bit of algebra is the product rule,\
The result being that the commutator of D and AB,\
is the commutator of D and A, all times B, plus A times the commutator of D and B,\
Not here that the order of A and B and the commutators are all important.\
This is because we are working in an algebra where A times B may not equal B times A.\

I find it amazing that, linearity and the product rule are within the definition of the commutator without ever mentioning slopes or derivatives or tiny changes.\
It mirrors that behavior from entirely different core behaviors.

Next we have an equation I'm not even going to bother deriving,\
but it's derivation involves the product rule from before\
This equation looks kinda like the difference expansion from the taylor series section.\
However, unlike that difference expansion,\
The derivatives are on the far left of each product instead of right,\
and instead of powers of change in g. We have a D repeated recursed in commutators of g.\
Interestingly, if we define the commutator of D and g to be hD,\
then it would become the difference expansion multiplied by D on the right side.\
But that is a digression.

I highlighted the first term on the left hand side of the equation because I want to emphasize that the chain rule is built in here.\
In fact, if g commutes with the commutator of D and g.\
Then, it becomes the chain rule.\
And if you define the commutator of D and x to be 1,\
then you essentially have defined an alternative to the derivative.

This result is one of the many things about math that I love.\
You have to different parts of math with different core definitions,\
Yet out pops the same result.\
Almost like how PI keeps reappearing in random places of math.

Another thing to note\
Is that there is a symmetry in the result that also applies with D.\
At this point in the definitions, D and x are interchangeable.

So now we can officially define the derivative using lie algebra.\
Abstractly speaking if you take concatenation of an object adjoint D and f(x) to be the commutator of D and f(x),\
the adjoint D concatenated with f(x) is equal to the derivative of f(x).

An interesting thing about this is the adjoint of D actually behaves the same as D when in a commutator.\
If you so choose, you can define D to be the adjoint of D. \
That way multiplying by D is equivalent to differentiation.\
And you can use the commutator to algebraically manipulate equations swap the orders of multiplication.\
This legitimized putting differential operators in functions.\
At least as long as it is multiplied by a differentiable object.

The final reason why I'm introducing a lie algebra definition of differentiation,\
is because it creates a correspondence between differential operators and domain transforms.\
Just like the correspondence between lie algebra and lie groups.\
It shows that for any domain transform there is a differential operator with similar properties with the derivative.\
All the neat things you can do with calculus you can do with these alternative calculus.\
It also allows you to create a mathematics of domain transformations.\
So instead of differential equations, you can have domain transform equations.\
You can define summation, continuous recursion, tetration, and even look at fractals from a new perspective.\
All fun and fascinating stuff.
