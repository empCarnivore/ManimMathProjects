So how do we use this definition to derive properties of this derivative?

Let's start with the product rule.\
Given the product of two functions f and g with change in domain form.\
And h to represent change in x.
If you substitute each equation's change in domain form with their change of range forms,\
You get a product of the two linear equations. Then just expand it and gather like terms.\
There then exist three terms. One constant with h. One linear with h. And the other is quadratic.\
The linear term is tied to the derivative as we defined earlier.\

The chain rule is slightly more complicated to explain.\
Given two functions f and g.\
Where g has a change in domain form and g is used as an input to f.
You can modify the internal change in domain form to be similar to a change in range form.\
The key insite here is implied by how I colored these equations,\
It's that this new form if g is also approximately a linear change in domain form for f.\
Assuming h is small enough.\
Then, you can substitute in this change in domain form with a change in range form.\
Then you just have to pull out the term tied to h like before.\

When there are more functions nested,\
The resulting equation kind of looks like a series of Russian nesting dolls multiplied or chained together in a line.\
Where the outermost dolls each hold a prime. While the inner dolls preserve there form.\
