        """Add content to the Scene.

        From within :meth:`Scene.construct`, display mobjects on screen by calling
        :meth:`Scene.add` and remove them from screen by calling :meth:`Scene.remove`.
        All mobjects currently on screen are kept in :attr:`Scene.mobjects`.  Play
        animations by calling :meth:`Scene.play`.

        Notes
        -----
        Initialization code should go in :meth:`Scene.setup`.  Termination code should
        go in :meth:`Scene.tear_down`.

        Examples
        --------
        A typical manim script includes a class derived from :class:`Scene` with an
        overridden :meth:`Scene.construct` method:

        .. code-block:: python

            class MyScene(Scene):
                def construct(self):
                    self.play(Write(Text("Hello World!")))

        --------
