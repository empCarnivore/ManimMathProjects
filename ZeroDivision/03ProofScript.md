To make the claim that zero divided by zero is undefined,
we must first lay out a set of assumptions.

The proof by contradiction looks something like this.

Every number, "x", times zero is equal to zero.

Dividing the equivalency by zero leaves the equivalency preserved.

The order the object are multiplied does not matter,
so you can cancel the two zeros in the equation leaving "x" preserved.

Thus, we end of with every number, "x", is equal to one.

This is a contradiction. For example, two does not equal one.
