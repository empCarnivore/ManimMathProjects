If you are anything like me,
then you are likely interested in anything 
weird, abnormal, different or seemingly arbitrary in math. 

This is the first in a series of videos I will be making in an attempt to construct a set view points I hold about exactly such topics
starting with zero divided by zero.

If you ever asked, "What is zero divided by zero?",
then you have very likely been told that it is undefined or indeterminate.

You might have just accepted this as an answer. 

After all, math is about a strict manipulation of numbers with defined relations with reality.

And zero division doesn't really make much sense.

What does it even mean to split some number of objects into zero groups even mean? 

And what which of those zero groups are you counting those objects.

However, as you progress through school math becomes more abstract, and less connected to reality. 

You have negative numbers. Negative multiplication. 

And all is fun in games. Until you get to the square root of negative one, that is.

As absurd as it is, the math community just defines an object "i", and claim that as a solution.

It seemed like we just made up rules, and now even numbers.

And so why can't we just do the same with zero divided by zero.
