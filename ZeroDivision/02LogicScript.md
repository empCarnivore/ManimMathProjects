To start with answering this question,
I am going to explain the structure of math and even truth itself.

First I will give a misconception about math and truth: 

The truth is inherently provable, knowable, objective, and disconnected from the human mind.

This isn't inherent in any human belief or knowledge.

Even math and logic are unable to fulfill such standards.

The best we can do is make a set of assumptions and from those assumptions reach a conclusion.

But we can always make different assumptions.

This is the foundation of logic and math. 

So in reality this is an enormous amount of freedom in truth.
