In that proof there are several assumptions.

First of all is the multiplicative identity of zero. 

This is a fair assumption.

However, there are actually areas of math that define objects or behaviors that have a similar magnitude as zero,
but ultimately don't exhibit this behavior. 

Such objects are extremely useful in area of mathematics such as calculus, analysis, clifford algebra, and computer science.

There are also areas of mathematics were the other assumptions don't hold true.

There are the sets of non-associative algebras.

And areas of math where multiplication of numbers don't produce a single output, or where "x" divided by "x" is not one.
